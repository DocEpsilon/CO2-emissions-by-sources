    "# Visualization of CDIAC-Data on global CO2 Emissions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to visualize the data on global CO2 emissions from the \"[carbon dioxide information and analysis center](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/)\" (CDIAC) over the last centuries. It is inspired mainly as a means to scrutinze the claims given in the positional whitepaper [on animal agriculture and climate change](https://climatehealers.org/the-science/animal-agriculture-position-paper/) by stanford alumni Dr. Sailesh Rao. He therein claims, that the share of emissions caused by animal agriculture amounts to 87% of all anthropogenic green house gas (GHG) as a lower bound.  While this is a sheer unbelievably high amount on the one side, he makes some excellent points in his paper. Honoring, the royal societies motto \"Nullius in verba\" (latin for 'Take nobodys word for it') I wanted to check the presented data myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This python notebook is intended to check in particulary one of his points and scrutinize the data vizualized in figures 2.3 and 2.4 in the white paper. The text in this notebook can be followed without reading Dr Rao's paper. However, I would strongly reccomend reading it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following python code is used to call the data from the cited sources and do the necessary processing to vizualize it.  Whereby presenting the code in this jupyter notebook also serves as means of transparency and tracability."

    "Instead of asking the question of how much  anthropogenic CO2 we put into the atmosphere yearly we can also ask, how much of the CO2 ends up staying there due to the various sources. In other words: In order to reduce emissions, which source would be the most effective to focus the cut on. For this we have to know two things: First, roughly 65% of all of the airborne CO2 gets sequestered by surface-plants, algae (e.g. diatoms), coral (or precisely the symbiotic algea living within the coral) and the micro-biome living in the soil each year. That means only 45% of the CO2 let into the atmosphere stays there. Dr. Rao calls this the airborn fraction in his article. Secondly, non-sequestered stays in the atmosphere basically forever. Energetically CO2 is a very stable molecule, that needs the suns energy and specialized enzymes to be chemically altered (e.g. in photosynthesis). Also it has a realatively high mass, so that dissipation into open space in the upper atmosphere is negligible. \n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "According to the underlying data historical emissions due to coal and land-use amount to 250 billion tons and roughly *on third* of all anthropogenic GHGs in the atmosphere today! With only 160 billion tons of CO2 from oil, land-use even has a far graver impact than all burning of oil, which includes the whole transportation sector, including airplanes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind, that within CDIAC's data set, the emissions from land use are not available for the years before 1850. Hence, there sum amounts to zero, although humankind has been pusruing agriculture and land use for far longer periods than it has been burning coal. Indeed the estimate is that the agricultural revolution began roughly 8000 years ago, while the industrialisation began little over 200 years ago. We can actually see it in the chart in fig2 with the onset of coal emissions in 1850.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to extrapolate or raise the data on land use emissions before 1850 it could be easily argued, that land use would remain the biggest chunk of GHGs in the atmosphere even today. In fact, there is [evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TOTsmqgmL8) that global temperatures began to rise even earlier than the industrial revolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes a strong case for those who say that a system change in agriculture is at least equally as important as a system change in energy industry and the transportation sector, because agriculture is the main contributor to land use.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand we saw that yearly emissions due to coal or oil exceed the emissions from land use by a factor of two. Only by cumulating past emissions became land use comparable to coal. Yet we can't change what is in the past. We can only change current emissions. Wouldn'it make more sense then, to tackle these big contributors first? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequestration potential of natural habitats and ecosystems \n",
    "\n",
    "No! To address the climate crisis all net carbon flow to the atmosphere from athropogenic sources must be stopped. Land use were still adding a whopping 5 billion tons of CO2, each year, if we stopped everything else but. Yet, as Dr. Rao points out in the article, something else is more important. Land use is the only carbon source than can actually serve as a sink instead. A good estimate of its potential is currently the subject of scientific debate. Much of the debate consider eco systems like forests of soil organic carbon in agriculture individually. Each of them alone has the potential to sequester all of the emitted fossil carbon, with more or less certainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. in [this article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706117300095) it is discussed that carbon could be sequstered sufficiently on cropland. Sequestration rates of 0.2 to 0.5 tonnes of carbon per year and total land ara in hectar are suppsedly possible, if we use less intrusive methods of agriculture in crop lands (e.g. reduced tilling). Calculating from these numbers we could cancel at about 37 billion tons of CO2 emissions per year. That's already more than our current fossil emissions, just by changing the way we treat our cropland. This is not even considering biodiversity effects. How much more carbon could be sequestered if we left nature restore its natural habitats?\n",
    "\n",
    "At least 80% of all global farm land is used to raise animal feed, while animals contribute only to [13% of calories consumed by humans](https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets). This is a clear waste of area, which could otherwise serve as natural habitat and help stablize the natrual carbon cycle. In fact, agricultural monocultures are one of the main drivers for the loss of biodiversity and towards the 6th major mass extinction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Concerning forrests: We know [from literature](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00587.x) that currently 35 millon km$^2$ and 25 million km$^2$ are used for cropland and pasture respectively, most of which have been cleared from forrests. And from the [FAO](http://www.fao.org/3/y0900e/y0900e06.htm) that forrest have a carbon sequestration potential depending on their region, ranging from 0.8 to 2.4 tons of carbon per year and hectar in boreal forrets and 3.2 to 10 tons for tropical forrest. Restoring 70% of that area, leaving 30% to grow food for 14 billion people the CO2 sequestration range would somwhere near 38 billion tons of CO2. Again, more than we currently emit."

I goes so show that symbiotic relationsships between ecosystems can extend by thousands of miles stretching between realms: Have you heard of the stream in the [clouds that's feeding the diatoms in the sea](https://youtu.be/vzRkHkssdME)? In short: Evaporation of water from the amazon rain forest, builds up to form clouds just at the top of the canopy, which drift west and then rain down at the andes. There the water washes out sediment, runs downstream though the amazon basin, taking up more nutrients bringing them into the sea, where they feed diatom algae. Those in turn photosynthesize carbon and produce oxygen and water. That is 50% of all oxygen in our atmosphre stems from diatoms all over the world not forests. In another instance salmon when they swim umstream into the forests of the northern hemisphere, in their death fertilize the fores by bringing nutriens from the sea. The northern terretories in Canada are dying because by fishing salmon on a large sacle we ware preventing that nutrients to reach these terretories. Which in turn comporises the northern woods in their capability as much carbon as they would, when they were healthy. Here's a [german speaking documentation](https://www.zdf.de/dokumentation/dokumentation-sonstige/hannes-jaenicke-im-einsatz-fuer-den-lachs-100.html) on that subject.\n",

Yet we are breaking that cycle by clearing the amazon and hindering the cloud stream from feeding the diatoms and expanding their full sequestration potential. \n",

    "As we can see in the green and yellow curves, we have the potential not only cancel emissions to a net zero with constant levels. We are also able to reduce CO2 levels to values we measured from before the onset of industrialization. And all of that is possible by just reviving natural ecosystems, even while continuing fossil emissions at current levels. This is not to say that we could or should get away with continuing fossil emissions. What it should show is, that current policies can only bring us so far. They can only bring us to a net-zero. Yet, things are already bleak for a lot of people in the global south even today. There is already suffering. Reducing emissions to net zero only stops things from getting even worse. That's why personally I get quite upset when politicians speak of a CO2 budget. There is no budget! A budget is somthing that you can spend from at your own  expenses. In reality we are in a loan-type of situation with debts way over our head.\n",
    "But by letting nature and biodiversity thrive, we can actually  follow the green curve, improve conditions for people around the globe and pay our debt back. \n",

    "Think about it: a damage that has slowly been done over a 200 to 2000 year time frame could be mitigated within the next 20 to 30 years! Most of us could live to see that happen. \n",
    "It's almost like a the body of a smoker. Long time damage to a smoker's lung can be [fully reverted]() by quitting damaging themselves day after day. The body heals itself, if we let it. In that sense our planet behaves similarly. Provided that it's not already to late and the \"cancer\" has not already spread. The striking difference is, that  with GHGs and ecosystems we have an actual means to take the harmful substance out of the system, while the body just accomplishes that, if we stop putting it there. This fact cannot be stressed enough!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the  sequestration rates used in the example above are rather wild guesses, and were deliberatly chosen to showcase the discussed scenarios.  But as pointed out before their order of magitude is well grounded in evidence and therefore within our grasp.\n",
    "In fact our best current estimates show, that carbon is sequestered by at least [2400 gigatons each year by soil alone](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.01.002). That means that an increas of  nature's sequestration rate by a demanded 72 gigatons per year, relates to an increase of not more than 3%. Yet it seems to be exactly that kind of percentage by which our species is hindering the biosphere to absorbe what is excessly emitted. Again, if we let the green biosphere grow and be diverse instead of cutting it down for animal feed year after year, we would quite possibly be on constant rather than rising CO2-levels.\n",
    "Similar ideas have already been proposed by french minister of agriculture StÃ©phane Le Foll at the 2015 climate summit. It was called the 4-per-mille-initiative as the nessecary increase at that time was only 0.4%. But the initiative's goal was only cancellation (yellow curve) rather than reversal (green curve).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this goes to show, that the best means to tackle the climate crisis as a species is how we treat animals and use the land and the oceans.\n",
    "If only we had the will to do what is right? Isn't it striking that the ethically right thing to do just so happens to be the same thing that can save us of from living in droughts and food shortages and suffering from wars of distribution and mass migrations?\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't believe that needed change in agriculture will be induced by policy makers. They don't even see the problem. In the land use data we saw that Europe, the US and China showed negative emissions, while total land use emissions where positive. So these governments will consider their slate clean.\n",
    "Of course, the assumption that these three did not contribute to climate change trough land use is still wrong. Due to globalisation and market effects cheep animal feed (i.e. soy or oil plants) is bought mainly from south america, by exactly those three.\n",
    "But the amount of imported feed and therefor the used area is only dictated by the demand for meat and dairy products - by us! \n",
    "\n",
    "The disussion so far only looked at carbon emissions, both in fossil emissions and opportunity cost from land-use. When cosidering what climate scientists call the radative forcing of all GHGs including methane, the evidence, that agriculture is the main driver behind and at the same time best means to avert the climate crisis, becomes even more compelling. Dr. Rao explains this in his whitepaper and clearly shows with his linear sensitvity analysis, that there is scientific bias even in the international panel on climate change (IPCC). I will not go into methane sequestration mechanisms or the details on radiative forcing. However, methane is primarly caused by agriculture, which is again supported by consumer demand for animal products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, consumers hold the true power to turn around climate change by simply rethinking or reinventing their taste. The only problem is, that everybody need to do their part. Personally, I'd rather see a vegan world than a non-vegan world. Mostly becaus of the evolution of my morality. But from a climate system's point-of-view there is no black and white. If this text goes to show anything, than that reducing meat and animal consumption is far more effective than refraining from long distance flights or optimizing or reducing our heating and electricity.\n",
